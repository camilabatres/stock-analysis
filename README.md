# VBA Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project 
Steve needed help to analyze the 2017 and 2018 green energy stock data to give his parents educate his parents about DQ before investing. In order to go through the stock data, we used VBA programming extension since it is very common system in the financial sector. 


## Results
###DQ Analysis 
We first analyze the DQ stock return percentage and for 2017 the return was very high but for 2018 it lowered significantly. This was a good way to show Steve’s parents how quickly the DQ stock return % changed from one year to another. In my opinion, it might not be a good investment to make because it is a high risk. 

### All Stocks Analysis 
The code from the DQ data was refactored for this analysis. For 2017, most of the tickers had a positive return except for TERP. This would have been a good year for Steve’s parents to invest in other stocks as well. The situation is completely different in 2018, most of the tickers had a negative return except for ENPH and RUN. These two stocks had a positive return in 2017 and RUN was able to go all the way up to the 80s%. 

### Timer 
It is more efficient when a code runs for less time. In the DQ analysis, the code ran for 0.7109 for the year 2017 and 0.7656 for the year 2018. This is very interesting because when I ran the code for all the tickers analysis, the code ran for less time. For both years, the code ran for 0.1328125 which is way less than the DQ’s analysis time. This is significant because the person who wants the run the code does not have to wait that long for the code to go through all of the data.

## Summary  

### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code 

By refactoring code, users are able to make the coding process more efficient. For beginners is its better refactoring someone else’s code because it serves as a guide and eventually it takes fewer steps to get an outcome tailored to the project’s data (just like we did in this case). IT also reduces the chances of making errors.  

Something that I consider a disadvantage is that the refactored code might have information from the project it was created it. This can confuse others(especially beginners) when they try to tailor the refactored code to their own project. 

### How does it apply to the original VBA script?

I had to use refactor the code from the previous exercise to complete this project. There was information from the previous exercise that didn’t apply to this project which was a little frustrating. 

Once I was able to understand that the we were just changing the tailoring the code to apply to all of the data, I was able to use the refactored code as a guide and use the sections as examples which was very helpful.
